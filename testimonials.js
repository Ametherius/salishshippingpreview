    testimonial: `Before I started using Salish Shipping co, rising postage costs were killing me and my small business. I was taking a personal hit on every sale that needed to be shipped because I just couldn’t fathom charging my customers what it actually cost to ship their item. 
    <br><br>Gabriel and Salish Shipping has been a game changer. I save a significant amount, no longer pay anything out of pocket AND my items are picked up right from my studio. No more trips to the post office. 
    <br><br>Gabriel is so awesome. The communication is wonderful and very prompt.
    <br><br>Couldn’t be happier and am so glad I found Salish Shipping co!`,

    testimonial: `Salish Shipping has upped my shipping game. For years I was wishing there was a delivery service with easy communication, because shipping valuable artwork can be nerve-wracking. Salish Shipping gives me peace of mind to know there is someone I can reach out to directly as I can get a quote and stay in touch via text… The prices are good as well, always lower than Canada Post with the bonus of pickup right from my studio. Recommend!`,
